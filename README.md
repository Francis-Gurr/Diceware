# Diceware

A website that generates a random passphrase using the Diceware method (http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) created by Arnold Reinhold.
This wasn't created to offer an alternative implementation of the Diceware method and I aknowledge that the following is not more secure/truly random than the analogue equivalent of using quality casino dice as suggested. (http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#electronic).
